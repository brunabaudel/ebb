# TestFlight setup

## GitHub secrets

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` | `3F274MB2RL` |
| `APPSTORE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` | Full `.p8` file contents (include `BEGIN`/`END` lines) |
| `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded **Apple Distribution** `.p12` (one cert only) |
| `P12_PASSWORD` | Password used when exporting the `.p12` |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Any random string for the temporary CI keychain |

## One-time: export the single Apple Distribution certificate

CI uses **manual signing** with one persistent Apple Distribution certificate stored
in GitHub. Ephemeral runners must not mint new certificates on every run — that
exhausts Apple's per-account certificate limit.

1. Open [Apple Developer → Certificates](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list)
2. Revoke extra **Apple Development** / **Apple Distribution** certificates created
   by CI (names like "Created via API"). Keep **one** valid **Apple Distribution**
   certificate for team `3F274MB2RL`.
3. On your Mac, open **Keychain Access** and export that distribution certificate
   (with private key) as `Ebb-Distribution.p12`.
4. Base64-encode and add repository secrets:

```bash
base64 -i Ebb-Distribution.p12 | pbcopy   # → BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64
openssl rand -base64 32 | pbcopy            # → KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD
```

5. Set `P12_PASSWORD` to the export password you chose in step 3.

The deploy job also runs `ci/prune_ephemeral_certificates.rb` after importing the
`.p12` to revoke leftover API-created development certificates, verify
`BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` matches a valid IOS_DISTRIBUTION certificate, and
warn about any other distribution certificates on the account (without revoking them).

## One-time: iCloud container for Phase 8 CloudKit sync

Phase 8 adds CloudKit backup. The App Store profile must include container
`iCloud.com.bcbs.ebb` (matching `Ebb/Ebb.entitlements` and `Ebb/EbbRelease.entitlements`).

1. Open [Apple Developer → Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
2. If missing, click **+** → **iCloud Containers** → create identifier **`iCloud.com.bcbs.ebb`**
3. Open App ID **`com.bcbs.ebb`** → enable **iCloud** → choose **Include CloudKit support**
4. Click **Configure** (or **Edit**) next to iCloud → check **`iCloud.com.bcbs.ebb`** → **Save**
5. On the same App ID, enable **Push Notifications** (required for CloudKit sync uploads)
6. Re-run **Actions → TestFlight** on branch **`main`** (or push a commit). CI regenerates the App Store profile automatically.

CI enables the iCloud capability via API, but Apple still requires the container to be selected on the App ID in the developer portal (cannot be done via API key alone).

Push Notifications only needs the **capability enabled** on the App ID. You do **not** need to create an APNs SSL certificate or Auth Key — CloudKit sends silent pushes through Apple’s servers.

## One-time: deploy CloudKit schema to Production

TestFlight and App Store builds use the **Production** CloudKit environment. Production does **not** inherit your Development schema automatically — you must deploy it once (and again after model changes).

Debug builds (`Ebb.entitlements`) use **Development**; Release/TestFlight builds (`EbbRelease.entitlements`) use **Production** with `aps-environment=production`.

1. Connect an iPhone and run Ebb from **Xcode** (Debug — not TestFlight, not Simulator).
2. Sign in to iCloud on the device, open Ebb, and **save one symptom log**.
3. Open [CloudKit Console](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/) → container **`iCloud.com.bcbs.ebb`** → **Development** → **Schema**.
4. Confirm record types such as **`CD_SymptomEntry`** appear (not just `Users`).
5. In the left sidebar, click **Deploy Schema Changes…** → deploy to **Production**.
6. Verify **Production → Schema** shows the same record types.
7. Install the latest **TestFlight** build, add a log on Wi‑Fi, and confirm **Production → Data** shows records in zone `com.apple.coredata.cloudkit.zone`.

After app updates that change the SwiftData model, run Ebb once from **Xcode on a device** (Debug), save a log, then **Deploy Schema Changes…** to Production again so fields such as `CD_iCloudExportToken` exist server-side.

CI runs `ci/verify_release_entitlements.rb` on every TestFlight IPA to ensure `aps-environment` is `production` and the CloudKit container environment is `Production`.

## GitHub variables

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID` | `0db26431-c329-43ec-a88a-7726ac48b535` |
| `APPSTORE_API_KEY_ID` | `L2WA39JRT9` |

Your **Admin** API key is correct for uploading builds. Apple simply does not allow creating new app records via the API — that step must be done in the browser once.

## One-time: create the app in App Store Connect (done)

The app record exists as **Ebbie** (the name "Ebb" was already taken on the App Store).
The App Store Connect name is independent of the bundle ID and the on-device display
name — CI matches builds by bundle ID only.

1. Open [App Store Connect → Apps](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps)
2. Click **+** → **New App**
3. Platform: **iOS**
4. Name: **Ebbie**
5. Bundle ID: **com.bcbs.ebb**
6. SKU: **ebb001**
7. Click **Create**

## Deploy

### Automatic (push to `main`)

Every push that touches `Ebb/**` runs **both** jobs in parallel:

- **Capture screenshots** — simulator PNGs + job summary previews
- **Deploy to TestFlight** — archive, upload, distribute to **Ebb Internal**

PRs run **Build & Test (Simulator)** only (unit tests + screenshots, no TestFlight).

### Manual (pick what runs)

1. Go to **Actions → TestFlight → Run workflow**
2. Choose branch **`main`**
3. Toggle the checkboxes:

| Capture screenshots | Deploy to TestFlight | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| on | on | Both (same as a push) |
| on | off | Screenshots only (~5 min) — no TestFlight upload |
| off | on | TestFlight only (~3 min) — no screenshots |
| off | off | Nothing (workflow succeeds with no jobs) |

4. Click **Run workflow**

For TestFlight installs after a deploy: wait ~10–15 min, then open **TestFlight** on your iPhone and install **Ebbie**.

To redeploy without code changes, push any commit that touches `Ebb/**` on branch `main`.

First upload may take an extra 10–30 minutes for Apple to process.

## Screenshots

CI can capture three simulator screenshots: **Today**, **Tap log**, and **Calendar**.

They run automatically on PRs and on pushes to `main` (in the **Capture screenshots** job).
On manual runs, toggle **Capture simulator screenshots** in the workflow dispatch form.

**Where to view them:**

1. Open the workflow run on GitHub Actions (e.g. **Actions → TestFlight →** the latest run).
2. Scroll the job log to **App screenshots** in the job summary — previews are inline.
3. Or download the **`screenshots`** artifact at the bottom of the run page (`screenshots.zip`).

Artifacts expire after GitHub’s retention period (~90 days). Screenshots are simulator renders, not from a physical device.

Scripts: `ci/capture_screenshots.sh`, `ci/write_screenshot_summary.sh`.

## Beta group

CI manages an **internal** TestFlight group named **Ebb Internal** — no App
Store Connect access needed. `ci/create_beta_group.rb` (idempotent, runs on
every deploy):

- creates the group with **access to all builds**, so every uploaded build is
  distributed to the group automatically once Apple finishes processing it —
  no Beta App Review, no per-build assignment
- adds `brubaudel@gmail.com` (the account owner) as a tester

The tester receives a TestFlight email invite on first run; after accepting it
once, new builds just appear in the TestFlight app.

Internal groups only accept App Store Connect **team members**. To add more
testers, add their email to the `TESTERS` list in `ci/create_beta_group.rb` —
but they must first be invited to the ASC team (Users and Access), which
requires the browser. For testers outside the team, an external group with a
public link would be needed instead (first build then requires Beta App
Review).

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `No App Store Connect app found` | Create the app in App Store Connect (step above) |
| `No suitable application records were found` | Same — the app record must exist before upload |
| `missing BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` | Re-paste the `.p8` secret with correct newlines |
| `maximum number of certificates` | Revoke extra certs in Apple Developer; ensure `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` is set so CI stops minting new ones |
| `Missing Apple Distribution certificate secret` | Add `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`, `P12_PASSWORD`, and `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` (see above) |
| `No valid IOS_DISTRIBUTION certificate found` | Create or restore one Apple Distribution certificate, export `.p12`, update `BUILD_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` |
| `does not match any valid IOS_DISTRIBUTION` | Re-export the `.p12` for the valid Apple Distribution cert on your account (must include private key) |
| `doesn't match the entitlements file's value for the com.apple.developer.icloud-container-identifiers entitlement` | Complete the **One-time: iCloud container** steps above, then re-run TestFlight |
| `Provisioning profile still missing iCloud container iCloud.com.bcbs.ebb` | Same — associate container `iCloud.com.bcbs.ebb` with App ID `com.bcbs.ebb` in Apple Developer |
